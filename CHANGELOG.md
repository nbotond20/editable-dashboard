## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Column-pin to entirely empty columns (e.g., `A A x / B`, B → x) now correctly detected as an empty zone instead of a gap, enabling proper column-pin behavior
- Auto-resize neighbor computation now uses the base layout instead of a greedy simulation that overcounts neighbors when the source is removed
- Cross-row auto-resize post-processing now allows target shrink when real row-mates require it
- Dragging to empty cells adjacent to a widget no longer blocked by cross-row gap detection extending into occupied columns

### Added

- `DashboardProvider` component with controlled and uncontrolled modes
- `useDashboard` hook exposing state, layout, actions, drag state, and refs
- Bin-packing layout engine (`computeLayout`) with masonry-style column filling
- 5 intelligent drag strategies: insert, swap, side-drop, row squeeze, column shift
- Pointer-based drag system with mouse and touch support
- Keyboard drag navigation (arrow keys to move, Shift+arrows to resize)
- Widget locking system with three lock types: position, resize, remove
- Lock inheritance from definition defaults with per-instance overrides
- Built-in undo/redo with configurable depth and `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` shortcuts
- Serialization and deserialization with schema versioning (v1 and v2)
- Auto-measuring widget heights via `ResizeObserver`
- Auto-scroll during drag near viewport edges
- Screen reader announcements for drag operations via live region
- Responsive column helper (`getResponsiveColumns`)
- Custom drop validation via `canDrop` prop
- Per-widget configuration storage (`config` field)
- Full TypeScript type exports
- `@nbotond20/editable-dashboard/engine` subpath for advanced internals
